# Extracting Attractive App Aspects from Reviews

This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Clustering Machine Learning techniques to extract and categorize attractive aspects of mobile applications from user reviews. The model is based on the Kano Model, which classifies features based on the impact of the presence or absence of a feature on users' satisfaction.

## <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

The main goal of this project is to use the Kano model and machine learning clustering techniques to analyze user reviews and extract aspects that increase user satisfaction. This is accomplished through a series of data preprocessing, aspect extraction, aspect satisfaction evaluation, and clustering stages.

## <a name="acknowledgments"></a>Acknowledgments

This project is based on the research titled "Extracting Attractive App Aspects from App Reviews using Clustering Techniques based on Kano Model" by Nadeen AlAmoudi, Malak Baslyman, and Motaz Ahmed from the Department of Information & Computer Science, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Their original code and data served as the foundation for this project and can be found at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NadeenAmoudi/extracting-attractive-app-aspects). We express our deepest gratitude to the authors for making their valuable work available to the community.

## <a name="usage"></a>Usage

This project is written and should be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment through Visual Studio Code. Here are the step-by-step instructions to set up the environment and run the notebook:

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you start, you need to install some prerequisites:

- Python (3.7 or higher is recommended)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Jupyter extension for Visual Studio Code

You can install Python and Visual Studio Code from their respective websites. After you have installed Visual Studio Code, you can install the Jupyter extension by opening Visual Studio Code and going to `Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)` and then searching for `Jupyter`.

### 2. Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository to your local machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnsL-U/App-Feature-Extraction.git
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Open Visual Studio Code and Load the Jupyter Notebook

Open Visual Studio Code. In the top left corner, click on `File -> Open Folder` and navigate to the cloned repository. From there, open the notebook files based on the order in project wiki's approach section.

### 5. Run the Jupyter Notebook

You can run the entire notebook by clicking on the `Run All Cells` button (double play button) at the top of the notebook interface. Alternatively, you can run the cells one by one using the `Run Cell` button (play button) at the top left of each cell.

Please note that some cells may take a while to run, especially if they involve complex computations or data processing.

Enjoy exploring the project!
