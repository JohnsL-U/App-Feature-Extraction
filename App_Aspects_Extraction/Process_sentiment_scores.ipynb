Regarding the personal , they always come to you directly on whats app asking to share location, knowing the app has your full details this is uncomfortable imagine the amount unknown numbers you will hVe . There are times where they don't deliver the order at all, then you have to chase them in twitter otherwise they do not refund your money back , staff attitude is low, they deal with you in not friendly way, weak in arabic and english as well, no respect in dealing  , besides if you live in apartment they refuse to bring it up . Delivery cost is high knowing the app shows only near by restaurant and  still high .

I'm not angry because the money was not refunded I am angry because you didnt do anything for the consumer in just one click you gain the money. Really it's really harami. I think you better check your policy again. Because what if it will happen to other consumer because anytime you can tell anyone to cancel their other and you take already the money. And one thing more that Doughnuts I order anyway it's paid? I know you can return it to your stall and sell it again so both of you gain the money you didnt lose anything because you even take delivery fee . What else can I say . Please don't do it to others , it's not good we are all working to feed ourselves , we work hard to buy the food we want to eat and to share to our family but things like this is not good.\n",

After that he sent me two pictures of my order and he told me to come and pick them up myself. When I reported this to the app and told the customer care specialists Yasmine she replied the driver was trying to explain to you the process of payment through the app!!!!!!
